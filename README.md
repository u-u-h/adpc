This is a fork of the Algebraic Dynamic Programming compiler code from
<http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/adp/adpcomp.html>. The
original code seems to not be maintained anymore; it was
Copyright (C) 2001-2008 Peter Steffen, Marco Ruether, Christian Lang,
Georg Sauthoff, Stefanie Schirmer.

The original authors are currently not involved in this github fork of
their code, so please do not contact them with problems, unless you
are sure that their original code is concerned.

On the other hand, I'd be happy if any of the original contributors
would be interested in further work on this.

Look at the original [README](README) file for usage instructions. The
code is free under [GPL V2](COPYING) license.
