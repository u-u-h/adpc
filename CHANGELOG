0.9 - 2008-02-22
  Changes:
    - New Java backend
        i.e. you can tranlate your ADP programs to Java source code
        see README for more details
    - ADP Typechecker
        available as commandline option or standalone tool
        see README for more details

  Notes:
    - the XML-Interfacer (needed for ADP to C compilation) is marked
        as obsolete - most likely the next adpc version will use
        the  Metafrontend (fe) instead.
